# Changelog

All notable changes. DADL is pre-alpha: in 0.0.x anything may change between
releases. The `calibration/1` schema is a draft and is versioned separately
from the packages.

## 0.0.3 (unreleased)

Applies the third review ([docs/reviews/2026-11-council.md](docs/reviews/2026-11-council.md)).

### Breaking

- `two_photon_visibility(..., analysis=...)` is replaced by
  `bell_visibility()` and `hom_visibility()`; the analysis type can no longer
  be chosen by the caller. HOM visibility now uses the dip convention
  (C_max − C_min) / C_max.
- Simulator and closed-form parameters are unit-suffixed to match
  `setup.yaml`: `dark_rate_cps`, `jitter_sigma_ps`, `pair_rate_per_s`.
- `load_setup` returns a typed `Setup` and refuses unknown or duplicate keys,
  wrong types (including `1.0e5`, which YAML reads as a string) and
  non-default policies.
- Rust: every public function returns `Result<_, DadlError>` instead of
  panicking; parameters are named with their units.
- `closed_form.series_hybrid_measured_rate` is replaced by
  `series_measured_rate` (the exact series model); the old formula is kept as
  `patil_usman_hybrid_rate`, documented as empirical.

### Fixed

- Corrected visibility error now propagates the accidentals' variance and
  uses the correct derivatives (the old error was about 10–30% too small).
- Corrected visibility above 1, negative accidentals and non-finite counts
  are refused.
- Unsorted input to dead-time filters and histograms is refused in every
  build, in Rust and Python (release builds used to return wrong answers).
- Overflow near the int64 limits is an error instead of a saturated or
  wrapped value (Rust used to report a false coincidence).
- Float timestamps are refused with a hint to convert to int64 picoseconds.
- The default policy fingerprint is pinned and covers the thresholds; rule
  tables are read-only; looser rules must go through `Policy.allow`, which
  validates the correction name.
- Licence texts ship in the wheel and sdist; the sdist test suite passes.

### Added

- `dadl quickstart [example|setup.yaml]` reads the YAML; `dadl init`,
  `dadl simulate`, `dadl analyze` (own tags in `.npz`/`.csv`); `--version`;
  `python -m dadl`; errors exit 1 with a message.
- Results record `policy_fingerprint`, `overrides` (with reasons) and
  `window`; threshold labels for values within 1.96σ of a threshold and for
  zero-σ results at a boundary; CHSH gets threshold labels.
- Shared Rust/Python test vectors (`tests/vectors/core.json`), a 200-seed
  pull study of the CHSH error, an exact series dead-time test.
- CI: release-mode tests, clippy, MSRV 1.74, sdist/wheel install test,
  Dependabot, a release check that the tag matches both versions and is on
  main, and separate build and publish jobs.
- CHANGELOG, CITATION.cff, a validated example calibration artifact.

## 0.0.2

First published release: `dadl-quantum` on PyPI and `dadl` on crates.io.
